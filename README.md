# Publishing-Workflow-Sasken

## Blog Editor Module – Team Contribution (Summary)

### What We Built
We added a modern Blog Editor to the platform, making it easy for users to write, format, and publish blog posts with images and videos. The editor is simple, intuitive, and supports all the basics you’d expect.

### Key Features Added
- Rich text editing (formatting, lists, links, etc.)
- Direct image and video uploads
- Type your name as author (no dropdowns)
- Save as draft or send for review, with clear feedback
- Author name is always shown on posts

### What We Used
- **TinyMCE** for the editor and media uploads

### Workflow
- Write your post, add images/videos, and enter your name
- Save as draft or send for review (you’ll get a confirmation)
- All posts and drafts show the author, content, and status

If you want to see the editor in action, check out `create.html` or `edit.html` and try uploading an image or video!
